- You've learned a lot
about writing prompts that you can apply to workplace tasks. In this section, we discussed
large language model, or LLM output. We examined how LLMs produce their output and potential issues you
might encounter in the output. After this, we focused on a key principle of prompt engineering, creating
clear and specific prompts. You learn just how
important it is to specify what you want the LLM to do, and to include supporting context to help it provide better output. We then went on to discover
how to improve the quality of AI output through iteration. It's essential that you
evaluate your output, and then revise your prompt as needed. Lastly, we learned about
few-shot prompting, which involves providing
examples to guide the LLM. I wanna offer a final tip before I go. We focused on prompting
large language models. You can use the same general principles when you prompt other
kinds of AI models too. For instance, the next
time you want to use AI to generate an image, try to be as clear and
specific as possible, and then iterate to get
closer to the output you want. It's been great guiding
you through the process of prompt engineering, I
hope you continue to apply and develop these skills as you leverage conversational
AI tools in the workplace. To continue learning, I encourage
you to explore the topic of using AI responsibly as
part of Google AI Essentials.
