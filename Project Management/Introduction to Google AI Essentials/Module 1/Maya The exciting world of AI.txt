- I'm Maya, I'm Vice President of Strategy and Operations at Google Research. Day to day, Google Research
is trying to figure out what are the things that can
change society and our business today, tomorrow, and in the future. We start by saying, you know, what's impossible in people's minds? What are problems that need to be solved? And how can we apply the
expertise that we have to those problems to provide a solution that benefits all of us as
people and also our business? One piece of technology at Google Research
we're very proud of, at this moment because there's so many that we've had in the
past that utilize AI, is around contrails, which is when you look up at the sky and you see the white
trail from behind a jet. And utilizing AI to try to understand how can we alleviate that because it has a very
negative impact on climate. Most technologies nowadays have either an AI component or an adjacency to AI. I'm very hopeful that AI tools will have a tremendous impact in a
positive way on us as people. I think that we're just at
the beginning of that journey. AI is one tool that I
consider a powerful one in achieving my life's purpose, which is to alleviate suffering and to help us progress as
people to a better place, to have a better society,
have a better world. It's not something that's not approachable and something that people
need to be intimidated by. We are all welcome on this journey.
