- In today's fast-paced world, AI is quickly becoming a standard tool in every company's toolkit. Navigating the emergence of
AI in the workplace is similar to driving down a busy street. Just as knowing the rules of
the road can make you a better and more effective driver, understanding the basics
of AI can help you to reach your destination safely and to avoid potential roadblocks. To begin this AI journey,
let's start by examining what the term artificial
intelligence really means. In this context, intelligence refers to the human ability to
perform cognitive tasks. A cognitive task is any mental
activity such as thinking, understanding, learning, and remembering. As humans, we have cognitive
abilities that allow us to make decisions and solve problems. However, there are also limits to how much information
we can process at a time. AI is capable of extending
our cognitive abilities, helping us to make better decisions and solve problems faster. With that understanding, the
term artificial intelligence refers to computer programs that can complete cognitive
tasks typically associated with human intelligence. Simply put, AI programs
can assist us with tasks by using math to learn from data. As you'll soon discover,
AI has the potential to greatly improve the
quality of our work lives and streamline business operations. However, AI isn't a magic solution to every business problem. As with any advanced tool, the key is to use AI to its strengths, and doing so requires careful thought and consideration of the
technology's capabilities. Are you curious to discover how AI works? Want to find out how AI
