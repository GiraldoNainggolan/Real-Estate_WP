- Hi, I'm Kathy. I'm a product manager
on the Google Labs team, and I work on CodeAI. CodeAI is ways to generate
programming languages in code so that software developers can use CodeAI to help them write applications. So I'm from Alaska and
we were the first family on the block to get internet. I'm one of five kids, so
mom had a signup sheet. So everybody in the family wanted to use the computer so much that we all just got 30-minute increments. I remember when I first
opened up a browser and went to a webpage, I saw other comments on it from people who were around the world, and I had no idea that you could
talk to people that quickly who are on the other side of the planet, and it just blew my mind. When I look at AI, and especially with
the advancement of LLMs and applying that to all
of the developer tools that we have today, I
have that same feeling of just being incredibly in awe of what is happening
and what we're making, what my colleagues and I are making. When you're thinking about AI and you're thinking about
large language models or deep learning or whatever application of AI you're dealing with,
at the heart of whatever that model is is a person
who is training it, who's evaluating it, who is
applying more data to it. Human-in-the-loop is doing
things like writing a prompt for the AI to give you a question, and then the AI gives you a
question and you further refine. For me, it helps me write code. So if it doesn't get
the code answer correct, I'll further prompt it to
get it to give me a function that I actually really like. So the way I look at
human-in-the-loop is a way to refine the AI's answers. There's a huge potential for
AI to do good in the world, and the reason why is because AI is a tool that humans created to help us connect with each other more and
help us be more human.
