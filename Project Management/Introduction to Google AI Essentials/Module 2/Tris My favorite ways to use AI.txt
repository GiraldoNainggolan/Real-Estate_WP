- I'm Tris. I'm a product management
director at Google DeepMind, which means I work on
Cutting-Edge AI Research. DeepMind is the team that has
the mission to disrupt what's possible with
computers and to do so in a responsible
way. Every day I come into work and I try to figure out what it
is that we can do to make AI and our research
just a little bit better, to organize better, to make our
team cohere better, to make sure that we get
products out better. I think working in AI right now is a bit like being around
during the Renaissance and watching science unfold and completely reshape what was
possible for humanity. I personally believe that AI will be the most
important invention of our lifetimes. I use AI in my work all the
time to come up with new ideas, to collaborate with my
colleagues, to change the way that I'm
thinking, and to test what I do. But recently, one of the
largest consulting firms in America actually released a study about
using generative AI to improve productivity of its
workforce, and they found that it improved people's efficiency, quality,
and accuracy. I found that to be the case in
my work as well. It's an amazingly cool, iterative,
creative process that can improve your life. I also use it for my personal
life. You say, "Oh, you know, my wife
really loves dogs, and cooking, and the
outdoors, and music, especially folk
music." And you say, "What would be amazing birthday
party ideas for her?" And you can ask follow-up
questions and find really interesting
ideas that I honestly never would've
come up with myself. Get out there. Experiment. You can learn this. You can do
this. Anybody can do this. Right? You know, my kids can use
generative AI tools effectively and answer questions and
explore interesting areas. And I know that everybody
watching this course can too.
