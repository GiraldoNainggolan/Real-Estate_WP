- Now let's practice
creating effective prompts that can guide an AI
tool to generate content. Imagine you want to use an AI tool to help you apply for a new job. I'll focus on simple prompts here, and you'll discover prompt
engineering best practices later in the course. To use Gemini, go to gemini.google.com. Sign in with a Google account. If you don't have a Google account, you can create one for free
by clicking create account. Once you're signed into
your Google account, you can start providing
Gemini with prompts. Let's say the job that
you want to apply for is in social media. Your prompt might be, "Write a cover letter for
a social media position." Neat. The response provides you with a useful starting point or template that you can customize to make your cover
letter really stand out. After adding some finishing touches, you send the letter off, and great news, you receive an invitation to
interview with the company. You can continue to use Gemini to help you prepare for the interview. Your next prompt could be,
"What are some interview tips to help me prepare for a
social media position?" The output includes a variety
of options to choose from. They seem to be insightful and tailored to the social media industry, offering advice on topics like what to do before
and during your interview. Fast forward a few years down the road. You landed that social media
job, grew within the company, and you're now in charge
of onboarding new hires. You can turn to a tool
like Gemini once more with a prompt like this one. "Suggest three innovative
training activities that new employees could participate in." Wow, those suggestions are really fun activities
for new employees. When using generative AI tools, it's important to write
clear and specific prompts. The more you experiment
with writing prompts, the better you'll get at using AI tools to accomplish your goals.
