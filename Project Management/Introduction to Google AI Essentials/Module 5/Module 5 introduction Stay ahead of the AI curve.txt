- Part of staying knowledgeable involves learning about
innovative uses of AI. One thing that excites me is how AI continues to
develop in new ways. This means there's always more to learn: more tools, more examples of how people have integrated AI into their work, more guidelines on how
to use AI responsibly, and even new types of models. Staying informed about
new developments in AI can empower you to use
it more effectively. My name is Sharbani and
I'm a Senior Director in the Core Machine
Learning group at Google. That means the teams I work with build the infrastructure and tooling that helps you build and
produce amazing AI innovations faster and easier. I'm excited to help you learn more about how to stay current
with developments in AI. First, you'll learn how
to evaluate new AI tools. You'll explore inspiring AI innovations and consider how others have
integrated AI in their fields. Lastly, you'll identify opportunities to leverage AI in the workplace. I hope you're excited
to continue this journey and explore strategies to
stay up to date with AI as it advances into the future. Let's begin.
